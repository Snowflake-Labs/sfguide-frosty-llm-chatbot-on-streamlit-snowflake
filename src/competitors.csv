Arch,"Bermuda-based specialty lines insurer Arch Capital Group has its sights on the Australian lenders’ mortgage insurance (LMI) market after making possibly its biggest local acquisition to date.

Last week the business said it sealed the purchase of Westpac’s lenders’ mortgage insurance (LMI) unit for $350 million at book value.

When the deal was announced in March, the two parties said the sale price would be determined at completion of the transaction.

Westpac says the sale price includes a pre-completion dividend of $52 million and is subject to completion adjustments.

Arch Capital Group says with the completion of the deal, it will to proceed to combine the operations of Westpac Lenders Mortgage Insurance (WLMI) with its existing Australian LMI company, Arch LMI.

WLMI will retain its existing risk in-force and the newly combined entity under Arch will become Westpac’s exclusive provider of LMI on new mortgage originations for a period of 10 years.

The deal with Westpac includes an exclusive 10-year agreement for Arch to provide LMI to the bank’s customers.

S&P Global Ratings says it views WLMI as a highly strategic subsidiary of Arch and recognises that Arch has had an affinity with WLMI and the Australian market since 2011, acting as a key reinsurer to WLMI.

“We also consider the strategy of the businesses to be highly aligned, as they operate in the mortgage insurance sector, and believe the acquisition expands Arch’s international footprint and improves its geographic diversity,” the rating agency said.

S&P says it expects WLMI to maintain its narrowly focused competitive position under the exclusive 10-year distribution agreement with Westpac, along with solid capital adequacy.

“Our view is likely to remain unchanged under the proposed plans to combine WLMI with Arch’s modest existing Australian mortgage insurance business, Arch LMI, with WLMI as the enduring underwriting entity and a noncaptive insurer,” S&P said.

Arch says the acquisition augments Arch LMI’s position as the only globally diversified insurer of mortgage credit risk.

In addition to Australia, Arch has mortgage insurance and reinsurance operations in Bermuda, Europe and the US.

“We look forward to continuing our partnership with Westpac and leveraging this acquisition to further establish Arch LMI as a market leader that provides innovative solutions and excellent service to clients across Australia,” CEO Global Mortgage David Gansberg said.

The sale of the LMI unit is part of Westpac’s efforts to focus on its core lending business. The bank has already sold a chunk of its non-banking assets including its general insurance arm to Allianz and life business to TAL Dai-ichi Life Australia",2021-09-06,https://www.insurancenews.com.au/corporate/arch-seals-350-million-acquisition-of-westpacs-lmi-business

QBE,"The future of QBE’s lenders’ mortgage insurance (LMI) arm is again under the spotlight after a newspaper reported today a number of potential buyers are keen to acquire the business.

According to The Australian, unnamed potential investors “are said to be running the numbers… seeking to pounce as the housing market shows signs of life”. The report says the QBE business may fetch offers of nearly $1 billion.

QBE declined to comment on the report when contacted by insuranceNEWS.com.au.

The insurer has in the past said it was evaluating options to optimise value from the LMI operations, and in 2015 shelved plans to float the business.

At last month’s earnings press conference, QBE was again asked if the time was right to rethink whether the LMI unit should remain a part of the group.

“I’ll dodge answering that question specifically I think,” CEO Pat Regan said. “I think first and foremost, we wanted to reduce the capital we were deploying to that business and the earnings dependency we had on that business.”

The LMI business, the second biggest player in the market after Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia, was impacted by significant premium reduction last year, with the combined operating ratio worsening to 58.3% from 54.8% in 2018.

“The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average claim size as losses resulting from the unwinding of the mining boom in [WA] and regional Queensland, continue to transition through the portfolio,” QBE says.

Net earned premium, on a constant currency basis, declined 8%, partly reflecting the contraction in lending over recent years.

Macquarie Research Insurance Equities Analyst Andrew Buncombe says should a good offer come along, the insurer should give it due consideration.

“[The LMI unit] is a capital heavy business and it would allow more US investors in particular to be able to invest in the stock,” he told insuranceNEWS.com.au.

“At the moment, a number of them refuse to because they are concerned about QBE given the exposure to the Australian housing market.

“So, if you removed that, all of a sudden, you get more interest in investors and theoretically the stock price would go up but I suppose all these questions are very difficult if you don’t know what the price is.”

Morningstar analyst Nathan Zaia, who tracks the insurance industry, sees no “urgent need or hurry” at the moment for QBE to divest the LMI business.

“While the growth outlook for LMI doesn’t appear strong, reductions in premiums and a strong housing market mean that despite becoming a smaller earnings contributor for QBE, the division has also become less capital intensive,” he told insuranceNEWS.com.au.

“LMI businesses can actually be quite profitable, but that’s because over the cycle you can expect periods where rising arrears put a significant dent in profits. The last thing a business would want to be doing is trying to flog the business off during that period.”",2020-06-06,https://www.insurancenews.com.au/daily/qbe-silent-on-possible-sale-of-lenders-mortgage-business
QBE,"QBE LMI has today launched a new 5 per cent rate reduction for LMI through its exclusive partners, designed to encourage and increase affordability of green home ownership.

This first-to-market benefit is available to LMI customers purchasing or refinancing new or existing homes, or seeking construction loans, with a green mortgage through National Australia Bank (NAB) or Bank Australia.

Green home loans must have an LVR above 80 per cent and meet the lenders requirements and QBE LMI’s minimum requirements of having at least a NatHERS 7-star rating or Green Building Council of Australia Green Star Homes certification.

Pat Priest, General Manager, LMI at QBE Australia Pacific, said the benefit is designed to support customers who are committed to green housing, or may be considering making the switch to green.

“We’re pleased to be working with our exclusive partners to encourage customers to buy or build a green home, or renovate their current home into a green home. We know that making properties sustainable is not only good for the environment, but also adds value to homes, so we’re proud to be enabling new and existing homeowners to look after both their present, and their future.”

In support of QBE’s commitment to sustainability, 100 per cent* of the LMI premiums collected that receive the benefit will be channelled into investments that have social or environmental benefits through QBE’s Premiums4Good initiative.

“We recognise the importance of addressing climate change and facilitating a resilient future for our business and our customers. By directing premiums into social and environmental impact investments, we can make a difference to the communities and environment we live and work in and help achieve our purpose of enabling a more resilient future,” said Ms. Priest.

NAB Executive Home Ownership, Andy Kerr, said the move is an important step in addressing cost of living pressures through energy efficiency at the same time as helping customers manage their personal climate impact.

“These days, people building or buying a new home are prioritising sustainable features and energy efficient designs. We also know that homes with these features help homeowners reduce their living costs which is absolutely critical right now,” Mr Kerr said.

“Through this initiative with QBE, we are making it easier for customers to reduce energy bills and home loan repayments with the choices they make on the type of home that they buy.

“Making buildings more sustainable is essential to addressing climate change. With Australian homes contributing more than 15 per cent** to Australia’s total emissions, this is a small but important move in the right direction.”

John Yardley, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Bank Australia, said the initiative will help support customers to make their homes greener.

“To reach our ambitious target of hitting net zero emissions by 2035, we launched our Clean Energy Home Loan in 2020, and it’s been great to see interest in green homes continuing to grow.

“This product from QBE is another incentive for people buying or building a new home to get the benefits of going green.”",2022-10-17,https://www.qbe.com/au/media-centre/press-releases/qbe-lmi-launches-benefit-for-green-home-buyers
QBE,"One of Australia’s largest insurance groups, QBE, has placed a temporary halt on offering Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) to specific groups of new mortgage borrowers. 

QBE reportedly told banks earlier this week of its move to temporarily freeze its LMI offering for new loans taken out by borrowers in COVID-19 affected sectors such as hospitality, tourism, gyms and beauty salons. 

""We expect responsible lending obligations would have put a stop to much of the lending to those impacted by the COVID-19 crisis,"" said a QBE spokesman in a statement reported in the AFR. 

""As this situation evolves, we will continue to work with our lenders to do what we think is in the best interests of our people, our customers and the communities in which we operate.

""We recognise the need to look at individual borrowers' circumstances and therefore all of our lenders have the ability to seek an exception to this embargo.""

Australia’s other major Lenders Mortgage Insurance provider, Genworth, has stated that it has no plans to change its existing position on offering LMI, though it noted in a statement that lenders will need to continue to assess borrowers’ circumstances based on responsible lending standards",2020-04-03,https://mozo.com.au/home-loans/articles/qbe-suspends-new-lmi-cover-for-borrowers-in-covid-19-hit-sectors
Westpac,"Westpac extends LMI waiver offer to nurses, midwives. Westpac is expanding an initiative which aims to put home ownership within reach for key healthcare workers, after early results showed a strong take-up among women. 

The bank will extend its Lenders Mortgage Insurance waiver to registered nurses and midwives – professions where women form a large majority of the workforce.

Under the program they will be able to access a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90 per cent without the additional cost of LMI. On a typical $700,000 property, that can mean a saving of over $20,000 on the cost of purchase. Applicants must have a gross salary of $90,000 per annum to be eligible. 

“Helping women to build greater financial independence and security is a priority for Westpac,” said Richard Burton, managing director of mortgages, adding that the LMI waiver program for health professions was a big part of that.

Loan applications under the initiative had so far been promising since its roll-out in April, Burton said, with female applicants accounting for around 60 per cent of total Allied Health customers. 

Westpac added more health roles to the LMI waiver in June as part of a package of measures aimed at helping women. They also included a commitment to increase the bank’s female workforce across home and business lending, and improved access to finance for childcare operators. 

The addition of nurses and midwives takes the number of health-focused professions eligible for the LMI waiver to 19, including, among others, speech pathologists and occupational therapists, where women also make-up most of the workforce.

ANZ,"ANZ is loosening its conditions for borrowers requiring lender’s mortgage insurance ahead of a two month national marketing campaign to boost home loan volumes. In written communications issued to brokers on Friday, the bank revealed that it would soften its LMI requirements in a bid to widen the number of borrowers eligible for its mortgage products. From today, ANZ will begin treating child support payments as recognisable income for home loan applicants so long as the payments do not represent more than half of a prospective borrower’s net income. ANZ’s previous policy excluded child support payments as recognisable income. The bank is also binning a requirement for low-deposit applicants to supply evidence of all funds to complete a property purchase before approving a loan with LMI. However, the bank is retaining a requirement for applicants to supply evidence of 5 per cent savings when the loan to value ratio is greater than 90 per cent. ANZ will also ditch its cap on the number of credit facilities that can be consolidated with a home loan. The bank currently allows only four credit facilities – including the home loan – to be combined under a single loan agreement. “There will be no maximum limit on the amount of credit facilities able to be consolidated,” ANZ told brokers. ANZ is hoping that the relaxation of LMI conditions will widen eligibility for its home loans along with changes to its fixed rate pricing policy. The bank has launched a so-called “lock rate facility” that protects loan applicants shopping for a property against short term movements in a five year fixed rate mortgage. Under the arrangement prospective borrowers can pay a fee of A$375 on a $500,000 loan to lock in a prevailing five-year fixed rate so long as they draw down the loan funds within 90 days. In a video accompanying the notification to brokers, Natalie Smith the head of ANZ’s broking business said the bank was continuing to invest in its third party servicing back office. In 2021 ANZ’s outdated loan servicing platform triggered a disastrous blowout in loan assessment times. “Last year, we made several changes at ANZ, so we can continue to provide the fast, reliable, and consistent level of service that you expect for your home loan customers,” she told brokers in a video. “We focused on improving the assessment experience, we enhanced our policy settings, and we increased the number of BDMs and BDOs, to better help you assist customers looking to buy, upgrade or refinance a home.",2023-02-13,https://www.bankingday.com/article/anz-loosens-insurance-conditions-for-low-deposit-home-borrowers
